# MATH 101: Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is the **first real language of modern computation**. Before algorithms scale, before intelligence emerges, before systems optimize: data must be represented, transformed, and reasoned about. That language is **Linear Algebra**. 

This course trains students to **think in high dimensions**, reason geometrically, and manipulate abstractions that power applied domains like Machine Learning & AI, Computer Graphics & Vision, Optimization & Control, Parallel and High-Performance Systems, and Numerical Computing & Scientific Simulation.

    | | |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Course Code** | MATH 101 | 
    | **Course Name** | Linear Algebra | 
    | **Department** | Mathematics | 
    | **Semester Offered** | Odd *(usually Semester 1)* |
    | **Tuition Hours** | 20 hours | 
    | **Course Level** | Foundational | 
    | **Pre-requisite** | MATH 005: Cartesian Geometry  | 
    | **Co-requisite** | MATH 102: Calculus | 
    | **Course Objective** | To learn the **language of high-dimensional thinking**. <br><br> Students will develop a rigorous understanding of vectors, matrices, transformations, and spaces, as **conceptual building blocks** for modern AI systems and computational reasoning. By the end of the course, linear algebra should feel less like a subject and more like a **mental model**. |
    | **Course Philosophy** | This course emphasizes <ul><li>**Geometric intuition before algebraic manipulation**</li><li>**Understanding before optimization**</li><li>**Reasoning before memorization**</li></ul> Proofs are introduced not to train mathematicians, but to teach students **how to think, present and argue precisely**. |
    | **Course Learning Outcomes** | Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to: <ul><li>**Solve systems of linear equations** and analyze the nature of their solutions (unique, infinite, or none).</li><li>**Perform accurate and efficient calculations** with vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors in arbitrary dimensions.</li><li>**Demonstrate geometric understanding** of vectors and vector operations in 2D and 3D space.</li><li>**Understand orthogonality and projection** and apply these ideas in higher-dimensional settings.</li><li>**Argue formally about linear algebraic statements**, using definitions, theorems, proofs, or structured examples to prepare students for abstract vector spaces and advanced mathematics.</li></ul>|

=== "**Assessment Plan**"

    | Component | Weightage |
    | --- | --- | 
    | Written Examination (2 hours) | 60% |
    | Assignments (2 total) | 40% |

    **Notes:**

    - Assignments will emphasize problem-solving, intuition-building, and formal reasoning. Unless you have understood the concepts, students shall face trouble solving the assignments. **Assignments are designed in a way that AI won't be able to help much!** (You're welcome. 🙂) 
    - The written exam evaluates conceptual understanding, not rote computation.
