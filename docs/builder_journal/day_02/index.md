# 02. Picking The Market

One of the most common mistakes first-time founders make is obsessing over ideas and underthinking markets. They ask, **"Is this a good idea?"** when the more important question is, **"Is this a good market?"**

**Ideas are easy to change. Markets are not.** A startup is not just a product; it is a bet on a slice of the future. And the size and shape of that future matter more than most founders realize.

A useful metaphor is to think of markets as oceans and startups as boats. You can build an extraordinary boat, but if you launch it in a pond, you won’t get very far. Meanwhile, a merely decent boat in the open ocean can still travel a long distance. This is why **markets with a large Total Addressable Market (TAM) are fundamentally better**. Not because competition is lower (it usually isn’t), but because **the probability distribution of outcomes is better**. In small markets, even the best possible outcome is capped. In large markets, mediocre execution can still lead to meaningful success, and excellent execution can lead to generational wealth.

Before starting a company, ask yourself: **If this works unbelievably well, how big can it get?** If the answer makes you slightly uncomfortable because it feels *too ambitious*, you’re probably in the right territory. If the answer feels neat, contained, and predictable, you’re probably not.

### Big Markets Are Not About Greed, They’re About Math

Founders often feel uneasy saying “I want a big market,” as if it’s greedy or naive. But this is just arithmetic.

If a market is worth ₹1,000 crores a year, then

* 1% market share is ₹10 crores
* 10% market share is ₹100 crores

If a market is worth ₹10,000 crores,

* 1% market share is ₹100 crores

**You don’t have to be more ambitious in the second case. You just have to be present.** Big markets forgive mistakes. Small markets don’t.

### Why Big Markets Increase Luck

Earlier, we talked about luck and how to be slightly luckier than average. Big markets amplify all four kinds of luck.

* **Chance I (Blind Luck):** More things are happening. More randomness means more opportunities to accidentally be in the right place.
* **Chance II (Motion):** Just by being active in a large market, you bump into more customers, partners, and ideas.
* **Chance III (Prepared Mind):** Big markets generate more anomalies, edge cases that look unimportant to others but reveal massive opportunities.
* **Chance IV (Luck Seeking You):** If you build specific knowledge in a large market, more people will come to you with opportunities.

Small markets are quiet. Big markets are noisy. Noise is where luck hides.

### The Myth of *Start Small Markets First*

You’ll often hear advice like: *“Start with a niche market.”* This is correct in **product focus**, but wrong when applied to **market size**. You should start with a **narrow user**, not a **small universe**. Facebook started with Harvard students, but social networking was a massive market. Amazon started with books, but retail was enormous. Stripe started with developers, but payments were gigantic.

A good pattern is **Large market × narrow initial wedge**. 

### Fast-Growing Markets Are Even Better

A large market that is stagnant is good. A large market that is growing fast is excellent. Growth covers many sins. In expanding markets,

* Customers are actively looking for solutions
* Incumbents are slower to adapt
* Standards are still forming
* Users are willing to forgive rough edges

This is why technology-driven markets are disproportionately good startup markets. They don’t just grow, they reshape behavior.

### Avoid Markets That Are *Big* But Closed

Some markets are large on paper but effectively closed due to 

* Heavy regulation
* Dominant monopolies
* Deeply entrenched distribution advantages
* Buyers who don’t adopt new vendors

A good market is not just large, it must be **open to new entrants**.

One heuristic: **If incumbents laugh at you, it’s probably open. If they ignore you, it’s even better. If they block you at the gate, reconsider.**

### Don’t Confuse Competition With Saturation

Founders often say, **"This market is too crowded".** What they usually mean is, **“This market is valuable.”** Competition is a signal. It means:

* People are paying
* Demand exists
* Value is being created

What matters is not whether competitors exist, but whether **users are still poorly served**. In big markets, they almost always are.

### Personal Fit Still Matters

Big markets alone are not enough. You still need

* Insight others don’t have
* Specific knowledge
* A reason *you* can do this better

But when choosing between a perfect idea in a small market, and a rough idea in a massive market, always choose the second. You can improve ideas. You cannot resize markets.

A startup is already hard. Don’t make it harder by choosing a market that can’t reward success. The best founders don’t just build good products. They place themselves where good outcomes are statistically likely. And that starts with picking the right market.

!!! note "The Markets They Ended Up Picking!"

    Each founder had crazy and innovative ideas to begin with. 

    * Om & Julias wanted to revolutionize the entire education industry by creating a platform that enables the learner to learn in their own preferred style, based on the **VARK framework** (Visual, Auditory, Reading, Kinesthetic). From the market perspective, the idea falls in the **education** space. It's a giagantic market with reports citing sizes upto $10 trillion globally by 2030. Also, I happen to have a personal bias towards education. However, their idea is still very raw and half-baked. There are a lot of improvements that are required: from drafting the problem statement to finding the wedge. Also, I am personally not a big fan of VARK theory, as it is not accurate. Refer to this video by Derek (Veriasium), [The Biggest Myth In Education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhgwIhB58PA)[^1].   

    * Suhani had 3 ideas! The first one being a sticker that you can attach on your valuables. If the items are taken away beyond a distance relative to your mobile phone, your phone will ring notifications. While she proposed this as a way to not lose items personally, I looked at this idea as a security tag for malls, supermarkets, jewellery shops, etc. However, this gets into the electronics and nitty-gritty details like battery life, would stickers need recharge, etc. It was a no because such ideas aren't conducive in India and building a hardware prototype in the timeline at hand is not possible. The second idea was to build a wrist band and ankle band, that monitors your form while you are gyming, playing sports, or exercising. If you get a injury, the bands will suggest the best plan of action (maybe a remedy or injury management ways). It had a great potential if instead of advisory, it does the analytics first and provide the best way to improve the form for atheletes. But again, hardware involvement made it tricky! Finally, the third one was to evaluate employees based on their behaviour and bring the culture-fit angle to the recruitment, and not just skill-fit angle. This is the **recruitment/HRTech** space. We had no clue how we will do, what exactly we will do, or any kind of details. I was pretty sure the entire idea will get revamped. But I stuck with this because,the market was massive! Reports say HRTech is $600 billion globally. 

    * Isaiah wanted to make small LLMs local and make it deployable in every company, so that they can securely leverage the AI power without needing to send the sensitive data to OpenAI. Secondly, he also wanted to visualize the chatflows (to maybe eventually create something like mindmaps). I was a bit skeptical of the idea because I wasn't sure how is this different from RAG outcome-wise. Now, Isaiah is from the US. US has massive pools of high risk capital. Deep Tech companies usually rely on funding for years, sometimes even a decade, and then eventually they hope economies-of-scale to work in action and become profitable. However, that deeptech playbook won't work when the goal is to generate revenue in 4 months. So, with a heavy heart, despite **Deep Tech** being my one of the favourite spaces which is massive as well, we had to drop this idea. 

    * Diego wanted to make a social media app, which eventually got modified to a dating app. Such ideas are classic **tarpit ideas**. Refer to this video by YC, [Tarpit Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU9iT7MW0rs)[^2]. Very common to get such ideas, very unlikely that they would make money without dark patterns. 

    * Sandra wanted to make a AI Voice Tech, where we make the AI voice more human. There are many applications of this technology: in real estate, hospitals, colleges, banks, insurance, etc. It's a huge market. But the current state-of-the-art models are also not good enough and are expensive if they are, making them not business feasible. To be able to pull off this project, requires great deal of technical expertise, full time research oriented mindset, and a market willing to bear high cost pilots. **Voice Tech** is a great space, just not feasible again. 

    * Diego and Sandra, both dropped their ideas, to become a team and they picked **education**, an evergreen space in India. Isaiah was merged with Suhani and will take his inputs, on if recruitment is the space, what would he love to make in it!

    | | Members | Final Markets Picked | 
    | --- | --- | --- | 
    | Team 1 | **Om Denkar** & **Julian Rojas** | Education |
    | Team 2 | **Suhani Makkar** & **Isaiah Fosnight** | Recruitment |
    | Team 3 | **Diego Avalos** & **Sandra Mollisaca** | Education |


    I wish we had more diversity in the markets that we'd picked. But right now, these markets do give us a good hope of generating revenue within 4 months!
