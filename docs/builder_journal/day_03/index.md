# 03. Market Research

Most people misunderstand market research.

They think it means surveys, interviews, reports, and spreadsheets. They imagine it as something you do after you have an idea, to validate it. In practice, that’s mostly noise. Real market research happens much earlier, and it looks much simpler.

It looks like drawing a map.

## Market Research Is Cartography

The most useful form of market research is not asking users what they want. It’s understanding **where you are.** Founders often jump straight into building because they’ve found a problem that feels real. The problem is that real problems exist everywhere. What matters is not whether a problem exists, but where it sits in the larger landscape. Before you design a solution, you should be able to answer a basic question: **What does this entire industry look like if I step back and view it all at once?** 

This is harder than it sounds. Industries are usually described as lists: competitors, segments, subsegments. Lists hide structure. What you want instead is geometry. When you force an industry into a 2D or 3D space, something interesting happens. You are forced to choose axes. And axes are opinions. They encode how value is created, how money flows, and how users experience pain. Choosing the wrong axes produces a useless map. Choosing the right ones makes opportunities obvious.

### Example 1: Education

Take education. At first glance, it’s messy: schools, colleges, coaching centers, online courses, degrees, certificates, content platforms. But if you choose three simple axes, the chaos collapses into structure.

1. **Age group served (Who?)**: Pre-school (< 5 years), K12 (5-18 years), Test Prep 1 (JEE, NEET, CET) (15-18 years), UG and PG (17-22 years), Test Prep 2 (CAT, UPSC, PCS, Bank, Job Interviews) (22-25 years), Upskilling (25-35 years) **(6 possibilities)**. 
2. **Distribution model (How?)**: B2B, B2B2C, B2C, Marketplace **(4 possibilities)**. 
3. **Outcome type (What?)**: Learning, Career, Operational, Discovery **(4 possibilites)**.

Now imagine this as a 3D grid. Every education company occupies one or more cells in this space. Some cells are overcrowded. Some are empty. Some are small. Some are expanding rapidly. Empty cells are not automatically good. Crowded cells are not automatically bad. What matters is why a cell looks the way it does. You don’t need revenue numbers yet. Just seeing the space clearly already gives you an edge.

Good axes usually satisfy three conditions:

1. They are easy to explain to a non-expert.
2. They correspond to real economic behavior.
3. They don’t change every year.

If your axes require a paragraph to justify, they’re probably wrong. If they’re fashionable terms, they’ll age badly. If they’re internal jargon, they won’t generalize. **The best axes sound boring.**

**What the Map Reveals**

Once you draw the map, several non-obvious questions become easy to ask:

* Why are some combinations missing?
* Which cells have many companies but weak products?
* Which cells have strong demand but awkward distribution?
* Which outcomes are users paying for reluctantly, and which eagerly?
* Where does regulation distort the map?
* Where does technology make new shapes possible?

Without the map, these questions never arise. This is why market research done late feels useless. By then, founders are emotionally attached to a single point in the space. The map threatens their beloved idea, so they avoid drawing it. Good founders do the opposite. **They delay attachment and invest heavily in understanding the terrain.**

Another reason why founders skip this step is because it feels unproductive. There’s nothing to demo. No code gets written. No users get interviewed. It doesn’t feel like progress. But this is the phase where most leverage exists. A small insight at the mapping stage can save years of execution in the wrong direction. Conversely, a brilliant product in a poorly understood cell of the map often dies quietly. 

### Example 2: HRTech

Consider recruitment. One obvious axis is the employee lifecycle: Hiring phase, Tenure in the company, Offboarding/Exit. 

This alone is insufficient. You need at least one more dimension. Possible second axes include:

* **Who pays:** Employer, Candidate
* **Signal source:** Resume-based, Portfolio-based, Network-based, AI-inferred

Pick one. Plot it. Suddenly, you’ll notice patterns:

* Heavy tooling around hiring, very little around exit
* Sophisticated software for engineers, crude processes for frontline roles
* High spend where hiring is rare, low spend where churn is constant

Again, none of this requires talking to users yet. It requires thinking clearly.

## The Idea Generation Mechanism

I don't consider myself a naturally insightful person when it comes to generating original ideas. Therefore, I think if I can create a system, a structured process, that can aid me in the discovery and identification of innovative concepts. The correct order, that works for me, is:

1. Map the industry
2. Notice tensions, gaps, and asymmetries
3. Form hypotheses
4. Then generate ideas

If you start with ideas, market research becomes justification. If you start with mapping, ideas emerge naturally. The best startup ideas often feel obvious after the map is drawn. Before that, they’re invisible. That’s the point.

**Market research is not about proving your idea is good. It’s about making sure you’re standing in the right place before you start walking.**

### SEAT Analysis

Ideas flow better when you do structured analysis of the industry.For each area on the industry landscape, you should ask questions in four sets: Structural, Execution, Outcome, and Timing (SEAT). It's more of an MBA-style business exercise, than engineering or product exercise.   

**1. Structural Analysis** 


1. **Market Size**: Who pays? Average ARPU Tolerance? TAM/SAM/SOM? Growth Rate?
2. **Customer Insights & Spend Readiness**: Behavioural Patterns? What they seek? When they buy?
3. **Regulatory Intensity**: Are approvals required for distribution? Are degrees/certifications restricted?
4. **Sources of Variance:** Regional, academic, social, economic, if any?
5. **Competitive Density & Moatability**: Number of funded players? Points of pairty (content, tech, GTM)? Switching costs? What moats are possible?

**2. Execution Analysis**

1. **Distribution Efficiency**: CAC vs ARPU? Sales cycle lengths? Channel power (schools, coaching institutes)? Digital readiness of the target segment?
2. **Learning Modality Fit**: Does the learner have the ability/discipline for self-paced? Or you need offline infra? How much does the outcome depend on mentorship or feedback loops? 
3. **Technology Leverage vs. Operational Complexity**: Can AI/automation dramatically reduce cost of delivery? Can personalization improve outcomes non-linearly? Can tech deliver a 10× better experience over incumbents? Tech must somewhere act as a pillar to differentiation. 


**3. Actual Outcome Analysis**

1. **Outcome salience**: How painful is the problem? How urgent is the problem? How much visible is the problem?
2. **Outcome verifiability**: Can you prove your product works? Scores or metrics? Observable productivity metrics?

**4. Timing Analysis**

1. **Timing & Trends**: Why now? What has recently changed? Tailwinds? Is this a pre-inflection, at-inflection, or post-inflection market?
2. **Capital Intensity Fit**: Does this space require long runway? Physical Infra? Regulated approval costs?

!!! example "Exercise 1: Market Research"

    All teams were asked to refine their idea using the above methodology. They were asked to submit 2 things. 

    **1. Landscape Matrix**: Map the entire industry you're entering. Choose good axes. Understand every cell. Use AI. 
    
    **2. Your Wedge**: Pick one cell from the matrix. This defines where you're entering the market. Choose what gives you the best chance to make revenue in 4 months. Justify it. We can pivot later.
