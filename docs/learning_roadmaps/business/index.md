# Business and Entrepreneurship

=== "**Bachelor's Program**"

    **Program's Goal:** Building Business Builders, Founders, and Early-Stage CEOs.

    This program is **not designed to produce employees;** it is designed **to produce business builders**. The curriculum assumes that successful businesses are built by people who understand value creation end-to-end: **market $\rightarrow$ customer $\rightarrow$ product $\rightarrow$ operations $\rightarrow$ growth.**

    A bachelor's program is usually **four years long.** This duration exists to give you time to build foundations before you specialize, and to revisit ideas often enough that they actually stick. The program is usually divided into **8 terms**, each designed to teach one important way of thinking and give you enough practice to see where it breaks. 

    The aim isn't to rush toward expertise, but to build something solid enough for lifetime!
