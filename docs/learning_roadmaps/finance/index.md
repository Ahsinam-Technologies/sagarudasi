# Finance and Financial Technology


=== "**Bachelor's Program**"

    **Program's Goal:** Building Financial Technologists, Quant Developers, and Early-Stage CFOs or Fintech CTOs.

    This program is **not designed to produce employees;** it is designed **to produce finance practitioners with technical skills**. The curriculum assumes that modern finance is built by people who understand both markets and systems end-to-end: **mathematics $\rightarrow$ computation $\rightarrow$ markets & finance $\rightarrow$ products $\rightarrow$ users.**

    A bachelor's program is usually **four years long.** This duration exists to give you time to build foundations before you specialize, and to revisit ideas often enough that they actually stick. The program is usually divided into **8 terms**, each designed to teach one important way of thinking and give you enough practice to see where it breaks.
