# Computer Science and Software Development

=== "Bachelor's Program"

    **Program's  Goal:** Building Technical Builders, Software Developers, and Early-Stage CTOs.

    This program is **not designed to produce employees;** it is designed **to produce techical builders**. The curriculum assumes that technology startups are built by people who understand systems end-to-end: **math $\rightarrow$ computation $\rightarrow$ systems $\rightarrow$ product $\rightarrow$ users.**
    
    A bachelor’s program is usually **four years long.** This duration exists to give you time to build foundations before you specialize, and to revisit ideas often enough that they actually stick. The program is usually divided into **8 terms**, each designed to teach one important way of thinking and give you enough practice to see where it breaks. 
    
    The aim isn’t to rush toward expertise, but to build something solid enough for lifetime!
    

    **TERM 1: Foundations + First Ship**

    | Course Code | Course | Objective |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | MATH 101 | Linear Algebra | Learn the language of high-dimensional thinking. It's the backbone of modern ML, computer graphics, optimized systems and many other computational ideas. It's the language of how every kind of data is interpreted by the computers. |
    | MATH 102 | Calculus | Data changes with time. Systems evolve with time. This course is important to create a mental model of rates of change. |
    | CS 101 | Introduction to Computational Thinking | This course will transition you from "this is a problem" to "this is a problem a computer can solve". Learn to think in abstractions and steps that computers can execute. |
    | CS 102 | Programming Paradigms | See that programming is about ideas, not syntax. Different paradigms teach different ways to think and yet reach at the same outcome. |
    | CS 103 | Fundamentals of Web Development | The course wants you to ship your code as early as week one! You'll learn faster when you'll actually build things. |
    | HUM 102 | Essay Writing & Storytelling | Writing is thinking made visible; this course sharpens both. Fundraising is storytelling. Recruiting is storytelling. Vision documents are storytelling. The best technical idea dies without someone who can make others see it. |


    **TERM 2: Core CS + Building For Users**

    | Course Code | Course | Objective | 
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | MATH 103 | Multivariate Calculus | Machine learning is optimization in high dimensions. Computer vision is functions on manifolds. This course enables you to see space the way a machine does. | 
    | MATH 104 | Discrete Mathematics | This is the mathematics that actually runs on computers: logic, combinatorics, graphs, etc. Everything from databases to compilers to networks lives in this kind of math. |
    | CS 104 | Data Structures & Algorithms | This is the vocabulary of technical conversation. One can't be a credible technical leader without speaking fluently about trees, graphs, and asymptotic complexity. This course enables you to think about codes in big chunks & ideas. |
    | CS 106 | Database Management Systems | Data outlives code. Most applications are really just sophisticated interfaces to databases. If you don't understand transactions and indexes, you can't build at scale. | 
    | PROD 101 | Introduction to Design Thinking | What should we build? What are the second-order effects? Technical power without judgment about impact is how we end up with engagement-optimized addiction machines. |
    | **PROJECT 101** | **Shipped Product - 1** | **Build and deploy something people want. Weekly reflection. Practice the full cycle: idea, build, ship, measure, iterate.** |  
    

    **TERM 3: Systems Thinking + Economics**

    | Course Code | Course | Objective | 
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | MATH 202 | Mathematical Transforms | Every signal processing system, every compression algorithm, every audio/video codec, relies on mathematical transforms. This will allow you think the application of mathematics in a completely different way. | 
    | CS 201 | Algorithmic Problem Solving | The grind of hard problems makes you better. Also, this is how you'll be interviewed at every serious tech company for the next decade. |
    | CS 202 | Object-Oriented Design Patterns | Patterns are crystallized experience. Learn what worked for people who built big systems before you, so you don't reinvent badly. | 
    | CS 203 | Computer Architecture & Operating Systems | When you need performance or are debugging weird behavior of your code, you need to know what the OS is actually doing. This course enables you to do that. |
    | ECON 101 | Fundamental Principles of Economics | This course covers the fundamental ideas of supply and demand, marginal costs, market structures, pricing. CTOs who don't understand unit economics and marginal costs can't make good technical tradeoffs or build sustainable businesses. | 
    | **PROJECT 201**| **Shipped Product - 2** | **Scale up. Handle real traffic, real data, real bugs. Keep something running for three months straight. Learn what breaks and why.** | 

    **TERM 4: Production Systems**

    | Course Code | Course | Objective | 
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | MATH 203 | Optimization Theory | Every resource allocation problem: from load balancing to portfolio allocation to neural network training, is an optimization problem. This course will teach you applied decision-making under constraints. |
    | MATH 204 | Probability Theory | The world is uncertain. Systems fail randomly. Users behave probabilistically. If you can't reason about uncertainty formally, you can't build reliable things. | 
    | CS 204 | Modern Web Development | This course covers the modern practices followed in building websites using frameworks. | 
    | CS 205 | DevOps & Monitoring | Docker, CI/CD, monitoring, logging, debugging live systems. This is the mundane reality of software that runs 24/7. If you can't ship code reliably and keep it running, nothing else matters. |
    | CS 206 | Computer Networks | Everything is distributed now. You can't build serious software without understanding latency, packets, TCP/UDP, and how the internet actually works underneath HTTP. | 
    | **PROJECT 202** | **Shipped Product - 3** | **Build something technically ambitious with proper deployment infrastructure. Monitoring, alerts, zero-downtime deploys. Ship it, scale it, keep it alive.** |
  

    **TERM 5: Distributed Systems**

    | Course Code | Course | Objective | 
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | MATH 301 | Statistical Theory | Hypothesis testing, estimation and inference are the foundations of learning from data. You can't do modern product development without knowing what your metrics actually mean. | 
    | CS 301 | System Design & Architecture | Learn how to design scaleable apps like Instagram, Uber, or a trading system. The holistic thinking that separates senior engineers from junior ones. This is where it all comes together. |
    | CS 302 | Distributed Systems & Consensus | CAP theorem, consensus protocols, distributed transactions, eventual consistency. When you're building across multiple servers, all the easy assumptions break. |
    | CS 303 | Theory of Computation & Complexity | What's computable? What's intractable? Knowing the limits saves you from wasting months on impossible problems. Also, the theory here is beautiful and makes you think better. | 
    | PROD 301 | Data-driven Product Design | Metrics, A/B testing, instrumentation. Modern product development is empirical. If you're making decisions based on vibes rather than data, you're already behind. |
    | **PROJECT 301** | **Shipped Product - 4** | **Build a distributed system. Multiple services, message queues, caching layers. Experience the pain of distributed debugging so you respect what complexity costs.** |
