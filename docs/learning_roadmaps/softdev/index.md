# Computer Science and Software Development

=== "**Bachelor's Program**"

    **Program's  Goal:** Building Technical Builders, Software Developers, and Early-Stage CTOs.

    This program is **not designed to produce employees;** it is designed **to produce techical builders**. The curriculum assumes that technology startups are built by people who understand systems end-to-end: **math $\rightarrow$ computation $\rightarrow$ systems $\rightarrow$ product $\rightarrow$ users.**
    
    A bachelor’s program is usually **four years long.** This duration exists to give you time to build foundations before you specialize, and to revisit ideas often enough that they actually stick. The program is usually divided into **8 terms**, each designed to teach one important way of thinking and give you enough practice to see where it breaks. 
    
    The aim isn’t to rush toward expertise, but to build something solid enough for lifetime!
